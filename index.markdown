I know the following programming languages
* Python
* C#
* Javascript(Node)
* GDScript (The Godot Game Engine)
* Godot Shading Language (As per Godot Docs "GLSL with the addition of a few quality-of-life features."

A touch of Java, Bash and the following markup languages
* HTML
* Obviously Markdown as that is what this site uses with Jekyll
* CSS
* And bootstrap though I have not worked with it for sometime
