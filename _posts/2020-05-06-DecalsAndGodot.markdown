title: Decals and Godot
---
Alright so I'll make this short and simple. Godot, my game engine of choice mostly due to its open source nature
does not have native decal support. I thought I could make the do by rotating a plane but I couldn't get over it hanging off the sides.
I was lucky enough to find the KiriSplat library for that purpose but I didn't know where to credit its creator.
When I looked it up I found that the MIT license it is under is unclear about that so I think I am going to I'm going to put a credit in the files.
If you somehow wind up reading this ExpiredPopsicle(Nice choice of name by the way) and are not pleased with me please hit up my email.
