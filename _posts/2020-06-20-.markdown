title: Privacy in an age of none
---
The internet right now is field of risks. For those concerned about
privacy the only choice is FOSS but even  then you can still be tracked.

The most common suggestion is a vpn but even these fall short. As 
CSO explains a vpn simply redirects your traffic to their servers and then 
it can be breached or worse yet the vpns can simply forward it to whomever 
they please(Depending of course on their license agreement). 

Some browsers that market themselves as data safe are still open to tracking.
Tor is probably the safest option but the average person is not going to
know about it or be able to install it. 

The problem here is a mixture of apathy and willfull ignorance. People simply
skip past privacy agreements. Maybe that has something to do with their 
length. Privacy agreements are long, extremely long. The average person 
just wants their software not an encyclopedia.
